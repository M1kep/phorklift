# Start

Run it with a configuration file:

```bash
$ ./h2tpd conf.lua
```

The configuration file defines the HTTP daemon's behavior. Besides, there are
some command-line options, which can be got by the `-h`:

```bash
$ ./h2tpd -h
```

# Stop

Kill `SIGQUIT` to stop h2tpd:

```bash
$ kill -QUIT `cat h2tpd.pid`
```

If dynamic configuration (which will be introduced at later document) is used,
h2tpd process may create shared memory files under `/dev/shm` and clean them
up on quitting normally. However, if the process crashes, it can't clean them up.
Then you have to remove them yourself.

You do not need to warry about this if you do not use dynamic configuration.


# Reload & Upgrade

It's the same routine for reloading configuration and upgrading executable file:
just start a new daemon and stop the old one.

The key is that h2tpd uses `SO_REUSEPORT` option on listening address, so multiple
daemons can run at the same time with listening to the same addresses.

If you just want to test a configuration file or raise the error log level, you can
run another daemon for a while and stop it later. You can also run it with just
one worker process (by `-w1` command-line option) to share less traffic.

TODO: How about the PID file??
