# Start

Run it with a configuration file:

```bash
$ ./h2tpd conf.lua
```

The configuration file defines the HTTP daemon's behavior. Besides, there are
some command-line options, which can be got by the `-h`:

```bash
$ ./h2tpd -h
```

# Stop

Kill `SIGQUIT` to stop h2tpd:

```bash
$ kill -QUIT `cat h2tpd.pid`
```

If dynamic configuration (which will be introduced at later document) is used,
h2tpd process may create shared memory files under `/dev/shm` and clean them
up on quitting normally. However, if the process crashes, it can't clean them up.
Then you have to remove them yourself.

You do not need to warry about this if you do not use dynamic configuration.
