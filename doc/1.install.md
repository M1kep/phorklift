There is no pre-build package by now. Building from source is the only way to install Phorklift.

# Envirenment

Phorklift works on Linux only by now.

It is developed and test on Ubuntu 16.04 and 20.04.
It should work on other Linux distributions too.

# Dependence

Phorklift depends on these libraries:

- openssl
- lua-5.1
- luajit-5.1
- zlib

If your distribution has `apt` command, install them by:

  ```bash
  $ sudo apt install libssl-dev liblua5.1-0-dev libluajit-5.1-dev zlib1g-dev
  ```

# Download

Phorklift includes some submodules, so `--recursive` is need for `git` to clone the code.

  ```bash
  $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/Phorklift/phorklift.git
  ```

Now `phorklift/` directory appears.


# Build

There is no `configure` by now. Just make it!

  ```bash
  $ cd phorklift/
  $ make
  ```

The executable file `src/phorklift` will be generated if everything goes well.


# Install

no install by now...


# Run

Start Phorklift with a simple configrate file:

  ```bash
  $ src/phorklift example/1.hello_world.lua
  ```

Then test it by:

  ```bash
  $ curl 127.0.0.1:8080/
  hello, world!
  ```
