There is no pre-build package by now. Building from source is the only way to install h2tpd.

# Envirenment

h2tpd works on Linux only by now.

It is developed and test on Ubuntu 16.04 and 20.04.
It should work on other Linux distributions too.

# Dependence

h2tpd depends on these libraries:

- openssl
- luajit-5.1
- zlib

If your distribution has `apt` command, install them by:

```bash
$ sudo apt install libssl-dev libluajit-5.1-dev zlib1g-dev
```

# Download

h2tpd includes some submodules, so `--recursive` is need for `git` to clone the code.

```bash
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/h2tpd/h2tpd.git
```

Now `h2tpd/` directory appears.


# Build

There is no `configure` by now. Just make it!
The `all` argument includes submodules.

```bash
$ cd h2tpd/
$ make all
```

The executable file `src/h2tpd` will be generated if everything goes well.


# Install

no install by now...


# Run

Start h2tpd with a simple configrate file:

```bash
$ src/h2tpd misc/hello_world.lua
```

Then test it by:

```bash
$ curl 127.0.0.1:8080/
hello, world!
```
